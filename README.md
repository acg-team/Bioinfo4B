# Bioinformatics Course for Beginners

A two-day course for students and other life scientists who are just starting with bioinformatics.

Prerequisites for this course: Although not required, familiarity with python or a coding language is recommended. Participants should bring laptops that have a working terminal.

## Objectives

We’ll start by exploring the most used bioinformatics resources for variety of different data sets, continue with a genomics practice on mutations. We’ll cover the best practices and common challenges in this practice as a foundation to the understanding of bioinformatics pipelines. Rest of the course, you’ll be working in smaller project groups. You’ll be able to choose projects on phylogenetics, immunobiology, cancer genomics and machine learning. As you can see, majority of the course will be hands-on allowing you to practice your acquired knowledge.

At the end students will 

- realize the wealth of bioinformatics database structures and the -omic tools 

- understand how to download and use data from bioinformatics databases

- learn best practices and common challenges in genomics

- explore downstream analyses approaches for bioinformatics datasets

- work on a project to practice acquired knowledge on a topic of interest

- work in groups on datasets provided by real life science researchers on phylogenetics, immunobiology, molecular biology, cancer genomics and machine learning

- present their findings

## Methodology

The module will consist of lectures and practical exercises. In addition to lectures, students will be required to self-study selected topics. Students will work in groups on a data challenge and present their results at the end of the course. 

Exercises during the course: 50%
Data challenge: 50%
The course is taught in English. We’ll be working in python. You may also use bash, R etc. depending on the projects. No prior knowledge in coding is required although familiarity with a coding language will be helpful. Please bring laptops that have a terminal. If you have questions, feel free to email Tugce Bilgin.

## More details about the implementation

There are two days of classes on the last two Fridays of May. Some preliminary reading and preparation materials are provided. First day includes theory introduction and hands-on exercises. The second day includes practical guided work on the group projects, discussions and final presentations.
