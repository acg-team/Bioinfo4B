Please follow these steps before the course starts. Write to us in case of any questions. 

We will be working in   [the High Performance Computing (HPC) Platform of ZHAW](https://wiki.hpc.zhaw.ch/hpcuserwiki/index.php/Welcome_to_the_HPC_User_Wiki). We will also call this platform the cluster or the server.

To be able to work in the server, you need a ZHAW Account that allows you an access in the server. If you are not affiliated with ZHAW, we created course accounts for you and will share the credentials with you in the beginning of the course. Once you are connected to the ZHAW network, using your ZHAW credentials, you will gain access to the HPC. We made sure, everyone has an account in the HPC and added to our work folder. If you are not affiliated with ZHAW, we have sent you your HPC account credentials, please check your mail box to find them. In your first time, you will be asked to change your password as here: https://idm01.hpc.zhaw.ch/ipa/ui/
