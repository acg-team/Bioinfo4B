We will be working in   [the High Performance Computing (HPC) Platform of ZHAW](https://wiki.hpc.zhaw.ch/hpcuserwiki/index.php/Welcome_to_the_HPC_User_Wiki). We will also call this platform the cluster or the server.
To be able to work in the server, you need both a ZHAW Account that allows you an access in the server and a server account. If you did not have them before, we created them for you.
