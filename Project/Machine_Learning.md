Here is the notebook.

The question is to build an algorithm that can predict the genic location of a repeat locus based on the sequence. My studenthas started it but did not have enough time to finish it. The idea is to learn how to build machine learning networks for sequences.
Please work on this project only if you are already familiar with CNN models/ machine learning since it is about developing something without much guidance. Do not expect results. :)
I have helpful resources in it. You will need to have a look at the those and the notebook before Friday and already spend a fews hours on the code. So this requires a work day before Friday.
I share with you the dataset below. Gave permission to Hana, Hui-man, and Xavier as they were interested.
